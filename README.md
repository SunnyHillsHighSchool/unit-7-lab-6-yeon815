# Unit-7-Lab-6

Lab Goal :   This lab was designed to review basic class creation and to introduce and demonstrate how to use an ArrayList.  


Lab Description :   Create a Word class that stores words and has the ability to determine the number of vowels in each word.  Use the sample runner code below to help you determine which methods you will need and how to define them.

Files : Main.java
        Word.java
        .replit
        run_button.sh

Sample Runner Code  : â€¨
Word one = new Word("chicken");
out.println(one);
out.println("num vowels == " + one.getNumVowels());
out.println("num chars == " + one.getLength());
Files Needed ::

Word.java
WordRunner.java

one.setWord("alligator");
out.println("\n\n"+one);
out.println("num vowels == " + one.getNumVowels());
out.println("num chars == " + one.getLength());

one.setWord("elephant");
out.println("\n\n"+one);
out.println("num vowels == " + one.getNumVowels());
out.println("num chars == " + one.getLength());




Sample Output : 
chicken
num vowels == 2
num chars == 7


alligator
num vowels == 4
num chars == 9


elephant
num vowels == 3
num chars == 8
